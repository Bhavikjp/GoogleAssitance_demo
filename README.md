# GoogleAssitance_demo
You might have used google assistants app to play music, to get some information and for other stuff. But your google assistant can do more, than these. Now you can use your google assistant to control your home appliances (here we have LED in place of home appliance) by just saying:   "OK Google, Lights ON"  That's it.

REQUIREMENT :

HARDWARE: Bread Board Wemos D1 Mini Board, Led, Resistors, Relay Module (Need to Buy If We Are Connecting Home Appliance), USB Cable

SOFTWARE:Arduino Ide, Google Assistant and IFTTT App in Your Smart Phone, an Active Account on Adafruit.io Mqtt Broker
LIBRARY:ADAFRUITIO_MQTT_LIBRARY YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT FROM HERE :https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library


To do this just visit http://opencorner.io 

**Control your home appliances from anywhere with your Google asssistant**

Let's start your journey with our OPENCORNER’s hardware kit!!
Open that Kit box.
